# Personal Chef

## Overview
I designed and built a website from scratch for a fictitious client offering services as a personal chef. I used a limited color palette to create a design that is simple yet elegant. I invented the textual content myself. Images were strategically used to feature the chef as the central focus to reinforce personal branding in the hospitality industry.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Conventions
The building of this website is in part to demonstrate a strong command of HTML, where I followed best practices in using semantic HTML code to create hierarchy and in properly formatting the code using consistent indentation throughout.

### File Management 
For this website as a showpiece, I separated (manageable) CSS files for readability; otherwise, I would combine all CSS into one main file.

## Flexbox Implementation
I fully leveraged flexbox in original ways to achieve the layout I want for the website - I provided code comments to identify the flex containers and flex items in every instance where flexbox is used, thereby demonstrating a strong understanding of how flexbox works. The site is fully responsive as well.

## Accessibility
Web accessibility principles are implemented to be WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliant. Text contrast meets Level AAA. 

## Version Control
- GitLab
