            <p class="padding-top-2">Chef Andy has always enjoyed cooking, a talent he discovered during his freshman year at the University of Toronto, where he initially studied towards a bachelor's degree in philosophy. Upon graduation, he quickly decided that he had to pursue what he was naturally gifted at. Andy went on to graduate from the Culinary Management program at George Brown College in 2016; he has been cooking professionally ever since.</p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-1">Andy has worked at many fine restaurants, including Spago, The Chefs' House, and 360 Restaurant. He had had the good fortune in 2021, for three months, to have been mentored and trained by one of the world's most talented chef, Gordon Ramsay. With a wealth of industry knowledge and experience under his belt, Andy now travels locally to provide personal chef services in Toronto and surrounding areas.</p>
